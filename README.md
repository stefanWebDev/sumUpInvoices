What it does:
-> adds invoice amounts.
finds last amount of Euro (in German format: xx,xx â‚¬) in list of invoices. Adds all of the amounts and displays the sum

notes:
first upload of invoices can be slow. Give it some time :) After that it works smoothly.

installation:
- in calculator.py: type in your initial directory where your invoices are stored (just for easier access, you can also navigate there)
- setup env
- install used packages from calculator.py 
- activate env
- python calculator.py starts the program
