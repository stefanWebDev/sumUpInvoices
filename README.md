What it does:
-> adds invoice amounts.
finds last amount of Euro (in German format: xx,xx â‚¬) in list of invoices. Adds all of the amounts and displays the sum

notes:
first upload of invoices can be slow. Give it some time :) After that it works smoothly.

installation:
- in calculator.py: type in your initial directory where your invoices are stored (just for easier access, you can also navigate there)
- setup virtual environment
- install packages used in calculator.py 
- activate virtual environment
- "python calculator.py" starts the script
